## Description

As a team we have been tasked to conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem. In creating our first collaborative full-stack application, we will combine a robust back end--with servers, databases, advanced APIs, and user authentication—-to an intuitive front end. We’ll continue to build on the agile development methodologies that we have learnt throughout this course, like storing your project code in GitHub, managing our work with a project management tool, and implementing feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.

## Installation

Start with cloning this repository link on to your local machine:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/laurawalters1/solo-traveller
$ cd solo-traveller
```

To install the required dependencies and set up the application, run:

```
$ npm i
$ source schema.sql
$ node server.js
$ npm run seed
```

You will also need to place a .env file in the root directory of the project, in order to connect to your MySQL database. Here's a specific example:

file: .env

```
DB_NAME=solotraveller_db
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=
AWS_BUCKET_NAME="solo-traveller"
AWS_BUCKET_REGION="eu-west-2"
AWS_ACCESS_KEY="AKIA2VOHTEYX########"
AWS_SECRET_KEY=
```

## Usage

Enter `node server.js` in terminal to start the application. Once a port has been presented in terminal then type `localhost:3001` into browser to display the application locally.
